- Build the Scientific Calculator
1. HTML Structure
Create the basic HTML structure of the calculator. Use appropriate HTML tags to define the
different sections, such as the display area, buttons, and other elements.
2. CSS Styling
Apply CSS styling to make the calculator visually appealing. Design the layout, colors, and
typography as per your preference. Use CSS classes and IDs to target specific elements for
styling.
3. JavaScript Functionality
3.1. Basic Arithmetic Operations
Implement functions for basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication,
and division. These functions should take two input values, perform the corresponding
operation, and display the result on the calculator’s display area.
3.2. Clear and Delete Functionality
Add functionality to clear the display area and delete individual digits.
3.3. Scientific Functions
Implement functions for scientific operations like square root, exponentiation, trigonometric
functions (sin,cos, tan), and logarithms. These functions should take appropriate input values,
perform the calculation, and display the result on the calculator’s display area.
3.4. Event Handling
Attach event listeners to the calculator buttons to capture user input. Write event handler
functions that respond to button clicks and perform the corresponding actions based on the
button pressed.
3.5. Error Handling
Implement error handling to handle scenarios such as dividing by zero or performing square
root on negative numbers. Display appropriate error messages to the user.
