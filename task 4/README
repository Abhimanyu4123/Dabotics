Internship Website Cloning Task-4

Welcome to the Web Development Internship Program! In this task, you will have the
opportunity to gain hands-on experience in web development by cloning a real website. This
exercise will help you apply the skills you've learned during the internship and improve your
understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Task Description:-

Your task is to choose one of the following websites to clone:
[discord.com](https://www.discord.com)


Please note that these are live websites, and you should only use them as references for the
cloning task. Do not use any copyrighted content or intellectual property from these websites.

Requirements:-

1. **HTML and CSS:** You will need to create the HTML structure and style it using CSS to
match the chosen website's design as closely as possible.
2. **Responsiveness:** Your cloned website should be responsive and adapt well to different
screen sizes, including desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
3. **JavaScript (Optional):** If the chosen website has interactive elements or animations that
you want to include, you can use JavaScript to achieve this. However, this part is optional, and
you can focus on HTML and CSS if you prefer.
